Good to meet with @Minette_Batters today. I will always support our fantastic farmers, who have worked tirelessly during the pandemic to keep our country fed. Outside the EU we now have the chance to get a better, fairer deal for Britain‚Äôs food and farming sector. https://t.co/tf6KtWx2UR

There is a real risk of a lost generation of girls never returning to school. We cannot let that happen.
 
Our global recovery from the pandemic must leave no one behind. 
 
On #DayOfTheGirl I urge global action to stand up for every girl‚Äôs right to 12 years of quality education.
Today we recognise the local, often unsung heroes, whose hard work and dedication has helped carry us through this pandemic. Their care, compassion and resolve is truly a testament to the sort of country we are.

It was also an honour to pay tribute to the 80,000 British soldiers who fought for the freedom of the Korean people, including the 1,108 who lost their lives. In this 70th anniversary year, we must ensure that this bloody conflict does not truly become a forgotten war. https://t.co/L01uTF1PnE
While in Korea I spoke at @wkforum and visited Seoul‚Äôs impressive Covid-19 command centre. We can learn from their pioneering approach to track and trace, which has kept the virus in check throughout the pandemic. https://t.co/RFAzGkXKTx

Deeply alarming that Novichok has again been used in an attempt to silence critics of the Russian state.

The use of chemical weapons is illegal and barbaric.

The international community must ensure that those who undermine our rules-based system cannot act with impunity.
Those affected by the Primodos scandal were ignored for decades but held fast to their campaign. That takes immense courage and it‚Äôs right that finally their voices have been heard. It‚Äôs also right that Govt has apologised and is considering the Cumberlege Review recommendations https://t.co/da6HZPbPYa

Former Prime Minister @theresa‚Ä¶
If you are suffering in an abusive relationship, know that you are not alone. What you are going through is not your fault and with the help that is out there, you really can escape.
The Domestic Abuse Bill will be a big step forward but it‚Äôs essential we seize the opportunity to go even further. I‚Äôve co-authored a paper on the importance of maintaining the Govt‚Äôs awareness campaign and the further domestic abuse interventions needed  https://t.co/0jpL7aZ9Qd
Today we remember all those who lost their lives at Grenfell Tower. My thoughts are with the bereaved &amp; survivors who fight, day in, day out, to ensure such a tragedy never happens again. We, in Parliament, must do all we can to help them. Their loved ones must not be forgotten
Today marks 3 years since the terror attack at Manchester Arena - a despicable act of hatred which targeted the youngest in our society. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their loved ones and all who were affected that night.
Today marks the start of #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek. Now more than ever, it‚Äôs important to look after our mental wellbeing just as much as our physical health.
